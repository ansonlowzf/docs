## Prepare your Development Environment

This tutorial will include instructions for two types of development environments: ***local*** and ***cloud***.

### üñ•Ô∏è Developing locally

If you are **developing locally**, using files and applications that exist on your own computer, then your development environment includes **the terminal application** for your computer's operating system and your **code editor**. In this tutorial, we will use VS Code as the code editor. You will use a web browser to preview your work as you build.

You will have a local copy of your files, and your repository on GitHub will be a copy kept in sync with your local project.

### üåê Developing in the cloud

If you are **developing in the cloud**, using StackBlitz or CodeSandbox, then your development environment is your **project workspace running in that browser tab**, which will provide a terminal console and an online version of VS Code in your browser. You will also have a simple browser pane to preview your work as you build. 

There will be no local copy of your files, but there will be a working copy stored in your online account, which you will keep in sync with your source repository on GitHub.

:::tip[working in the cloud?]
There's no local development to set up! Your project will automatically run in development mode and display a website preview when you open the "Completely Empty" template from https://astro.new in StackBlitz or CodeSandbox. 

**Next Steps**: 
1. Click the button to "fork" the template (save to your own account dashboard).
2. Skip ahead in this tutorial to [view a preview of your site](#view-a-preview-of-your-website).
:::

## Run the `create-astro` setup wizard

The preferred way to create a new Astro site is through our `create-astro` setup wizard.

1. In the command line of your terminal, run the command:
`npm create astro@latest`
2. Confirm `y` to install `create-astro`
3. When the prompt asks, "Where would you like to create your app?" type in the name of a folder to create a new directory for your project:
`./astro-site`

    :::note
    A new Astro project can only be created in a completely empty folder, so choose a name for your folder that does not already exist!
    :::

3. You will see a short list of starter templates to choose from. Use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate to the "Completely Empty" template, and then press return (enter) to submit your choice. 

4. When the prompt asks, "Would you like us to run npm install?" type `y`.

5. When the prompt asks, "Initialize a git repository?" type `y`.

6. When the prompt asks you to select a TypeScript option, select "Relaxed."

When the create-astro install wizard is complete, you will see some recommended instructions ("Next Steps") on your screen to follow that will help you complete setup and start your new project. You will follow those steps inside of VS Code, instead of continuing in this Terminal.

## Prepare your Code Editor

### Open your Project Folder in VS Code

When you start VS Code, you will be prompted to open a folder. Choose the folder that you created during the setup wizard. Your project workspace now contains all the files necessary for an Astro website. You should see these files in the Explorer pane in VS Code.

### Install the Astro language extension
If this is your first time opening an Astro project, you should see a pop-up notification asking you if you would like to install recommended extensions. Click to see the recommended extensions, and choose the offical Astro support for Visual Studio Code.  (You can always add this later)

### Make the terminal visible
If this is your first time using VS Code, you might not realize that you can now use the terminal built right into this window, instead of your computer's Terminal program!

This pane might be hidden (minimized) by default. You can make it visible through the navigation menu items under <kbd>View</kbd> > <kbd>Terminal</kbd>.

You should see the command prompt indicating that you are in your project folder, such as:

```sh
user@machine:~/astro-site$
```

## Run Astro

In order to preview your project files _as a website_ while you work, you will need Astro to be running in development (dev) mode.

### Start the dev server

1. Run the command to start the Astro dev server by typing into VS Code's terminal:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    Now you should see confirmation in the terminal that Astro is running in dev mode. üöÄ

## View a preview of your website

Your project files contain all the code necessary to display an Astro website, but it's your web browser that **renders** your site. The browser is responsible for displaying your code as web pages.

:::tip[developing in the cloud?]
You will see small preview window of your site opened automatically! 

You can also click the icon in the upper right corner of the preview pane, or copy and paste the preview's URL to open your site in a new browser tab.
:::

1. Open a new tab in your internet browser and type in the address `https://localhost:3000` to see a live preview of your new Astro website!

    Here's what the Astro "Completely empty" starter website should look like in your browser:

    ![A blank white page with the word Astro at the top.](/tutorial/minimal.png)


## Edit your page

1. Find the file `index.astro` located at the file path `astro-site/src/pages` and click on it to open the file's contents in an editable tab. You should be able to see its file contents: a short snippet of HTML.

    The contents of your `index.astro` file should look like this:

    ```astro
    ---
    // src/pages/index.astro
    ---
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Astro</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Astro</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

2. Edit the content of your page `<body>`
Type in the editor to change the the header text on your page and save the change.

    ```diff
    - <h1>Astro</h1>
    + <h1>My Astro Site</h1>
    ```

3. Check the browser preview and you should see your page content updated to the new text.

That's it! Now you are ready to make and see changes to your code and build your very own Astro website!

:::note[customize your view]
VS code has many screen sections available to you all at once. You may want to resize these panes to make the terminal smaller (you won't use it often while running in dev mode) or to minimize your list of files to give you the most area for your code.
